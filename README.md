# Applying-Encryption-And-Hashing-Algorithms-for-Secure-Communication
This lab demonstrates how hashing and GPG encryption protect data integrity and confidentiality. I generated MD5/SHA-1 hashes, detected file modifications, created GPG key pairs, exchanged public keys, and securely encrypted and decrypted messages between users.
